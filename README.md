Repository of "Yet Another Library" implementation for something like Markdown, YAML, JSON...

## Why I create these stuffs

I am not happy with a big library for a side thing likes markdown, yaml. There are big and complex implementation of them.

In short, I reinvent the wheel, but smaller wheel and it may has some avantages over the existing one.

However, it takes time to develop and to test, much as I did not think it would be. Finally, I have completed this:

1. The strict markdown parser and render as well, it is the [strict-mark]. Lets read about the eBNF of the strict mark at [The syntax of strict mark](https://myquartz.guthub.io/my-yalib/strict-mark.html)
2. to be developed.
