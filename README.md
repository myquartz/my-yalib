A repository for **"Yet Another Library"** implementations, covering formats like Markdown, YAML, JSON, and more.

## Why I Created These Libraries

I wasn't satisfied with the large, complex libraries available for side projects involving formats like Markdown or YAML. These libraries are often bulky and overcomplicated for what I need.

In essence, I've chosen to **reinvent the wheel**, but my goal is to create a **smaller and lighter wheel** that still offers some advantages over existing options. One key compromise I've made to achieve a lightweight library is enforcing **strict syntax**, unlike the more lenient syntax allowed by other libraries.

The development and testing have taken more time than I initially expected. However, I've managed to complete the first project:

1. The strict Markdown parser and renderer, known as the **strict-mark** library. You can explore the eBNF grammar of strict-mark in detail at [The Syntax of Strict-Mark](https://myquartz.github.io/my-yalib/strict-mark.html). Let's take a look to the Java source code and compiled package at **`strict-mark/`** directory.

*More to come...*
