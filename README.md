Repository of "Yet Another Library" implementation for something like Markdown, YAML, JSON...

## Why I create these stuffs

I am not happy with a big library for a side thing likes markdown, yaml. They are big library and they are complex implementation as well.

In short, I reinvent the wheel, but smaller wheel and it may have some avantages over the existing one. The one feature I am sacrified for the lightweight library is strictly syntax compare to others.

However, it takes time to develop and to test, much as I did not think it would be. Finally, I have completed one:

1. The strict markdown parser and render as well, it is the **strict-mark\** library. Lets read about the eBNF of the strict mark at [The syntax of strict mark](https://myquartz.github.io/my-yalib/strict-mark.html).

*to be developed..*
